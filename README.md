# Apps

A bunch of PWA apps I made with a shared design language. Trying to extract all common components and functions for easier development and uniformity.

## Projects

-   [`kader`](./projects/kader/): Offline First Membership Identification App
-   [`eight`](./projects/eight/): Hangout location sharing app

## Packages

-   [`@shared/ui`](./packages/ui/): Shared Svelte components, mainly customized [shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/) components
